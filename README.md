# Forge

A goal-centric planning system where an AI collaborator helps you decide **what to do today** by generating context-aware daily events from your long-term goals.

## Overview

Forge inverts the traditional productivity model:

- **Goals are long-lived and primary** - Define your high-level objectives with due dates and context
- **Tasks are temporary and AI-suggested** - The system proposes daily events based on your goals
- **Calendar as execution surface** - Schedule suggested tasks as time blocks on your calendar
- **AI proposes, you dispose** - All suggestions are optional; you maintain full autonomy

Instead of micromanaging todo lists, Forge helps you answer "what should I work on today?" by reasoning about your goals, deadlines, and available time.

## Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **Next.js 16** - React framework with App Router
- **React 19** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Chakra UI v3** - Component library with Ark UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling
- **FullCalendar** - Interactive calendar component with time grid view

### State Management

- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management for goals and calendar events
- Goal data structure includes:
  - Title, description, and due date
  - Events with completion status and time estimates
  - Custom info tags (owner, priority, etc.)

### AI Integration

- **@assistant-ui/react** - Chat interface components
- **Anthropic SDK** - AI-powered planning and task assistance
- Custom system prompts for goal breakdown and scheduling
- Real-time streaming responses

## Key Features

- **Goal-Centric Planning**: Goals are the source of truth, not individual tasks
- **AI-Generated Events**: Daily task suggestions derived from your long-term goals
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: AI reasons about deadlines, progress, and available time
- **Calendar-Based Execution**: Visual time blocking with drag-and-drop scheduling
- **Thinking Partner**: Chat with AI about your goals to decide what to work on
- **User Autonomy**: All AI suggestions are optional; you maintain full control
- **Theme Support**: Full light/dark mode support
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Design Philosophy

Forge follows these core principles:

1. **Goals over tasks** - Tasks are derived, not authored as truth
2. **Suggestion over obligation** - AI outputs are always optional
3. **Local clarity over global optimization** - Help you choose the next right thing, not the perfect plan
4. **Minimal surfaces** - Every UI element justifies its existence
5. **Human-interpretable reasoning** - AI suggestions are explainable

Forge exists to reduce activation energy and help you decide what to do today, not to enforce discipline or create guilt.
