# Forge — Project Vision

## One-sentence purpose
Forge is a goal-centric planning system where an AI collaborator helps users decide *what to do today* by proposing context-aware tasks, rather than asking users to micromanage to-do lists.

## The problem
Most productivity tools:
- Treat tasks as the source of truth
- Require constant manual upkeep
- Encourage guilt, streaks, and nagging notifications
- Optimize for logging work, not deciding work

This increases cognitive overhead and often amplifies procrastination rather than reducing it.

## Core idea
Forge inverts the model:
- **Goals are long-lived and primary**
- **Tasks are temporary and suggested**
- **AI proposes, the user disposes**

The system exists to reduce activation energy, not to enforce discipline.

## What Forge is
- A thinking partner for planning
- A goal-aware system with memory
- A calendar-based execution surface
- A tool that respects user autonomy

## What Forge is not
- Not a habit tracker
- Not a streak-based accountability app
- Not a gamified productivity system
- Not a notification-driven nagging tool

## Design principles
1. **Goals over tasks**  
   Tasks are derived, not authored as truth.

2. **Suggestion over obligation**  
   AI outputs are always optional.

3. **Local clarity over global optimization**  
   Help the user choose the *next right thing*, not the perfect plan.

4. **Minimal surfaces**  
   Every new UI element must justify its existence.

5. **Human-interpretable reasoning**  
   When possible, AI suggestions should be explainable.

## Long-term direction
- Full-stack architecture with a clean API boundary
- Persistent goal memory and summarization
- Planner services that reason about deadlines, energy, and context
- Optional integrations (calendar, notes), never required

## Current scope
- Frontend-first development
- Minimal calendar
- Mocked backend/API layer
- Explicit architectural seams for future expansion
