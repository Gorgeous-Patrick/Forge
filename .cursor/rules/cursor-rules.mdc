# Cursor Rules Loader (Repo Contract)

These `.mdc` files are the *highest priority* instructions for AI behavior in this repository.

## Rule application order
1. Obey all `alwaysApply: true` rules in `.cursor/rules/`.
2. If multiple rules apply, prefer the more specific rule (e.g., `frontend-*` overrides `project-*`).
3. If the user request conflicts with rules, ask for clarification only if absolutely necessary; otherwise follow rules and explain the tradeoff briefly.

## Where to look for project truth
- Prefer reading existing code over inventing patterns.
- Prefer configs/docs in this order:
  1) `README.md`
  2) `package.json` scripts + deps
  3) `tsconfig*.json`, `vite.config.*`
  4) `.eslintrc*`, `prettier*`
  5) Existing components/utilities

## Editing discipline
- Keep diffs minimal and localized.
- Do not reformat unrelated files.
- Do not rename public APIs unless requested.
- If you must make a breaking change, call it out explicitly.

## Output requirements
When generating code:
- Provide file paths and full file contents for new files.
- For edits: show *only* changed sections or a clear patch-style snippet.
- Include quick “how to run / test” steps when relevant.

## Project philosophy
Before making architectural or UX decisions, read `VISION.md` and treat it as a hard constraint.
