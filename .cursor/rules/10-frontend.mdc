# Frontend Conventions

## Styling
- Follow existing styling approach in the repo (CSS modules / Tailwind / plain CSS).
- Keep styling close to components; avoid global CSS unless necessary.
- Prefer accessible UI:
  - semantic elements
  - labels for inputs
  - keyboard navigation where relevant

## API & data fetching
- Centralize API calls in a small client module.
- Return typed responses; handle non-200 responses.
- Prefer cancellable requests for typeahead/search where relevant.

## Forms
- Validate at submit and show inline errors.
- Disable submit while pending; prevent double-submission.

## Dates & time
- Be careful with time zones; avoid mixing local/UTC accidentally.
